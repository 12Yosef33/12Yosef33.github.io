			<h1>Ethiopian Food: The 5 best dishes</h1>
			<img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_900,c_fill,g_auto,h_506,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190205150343-kitfo.jpg">

			<p>
				Ethiopian food is distinctive and delicious, befitting a remarkable country with a cultural heritage that stands out from the rest of Africa.</p>
			<p>
				While the cuisine of Ethiopia is gradually becoming better known, it's no overstatement to say it remains one of the world's best-kept secrets.
			</p>

			<p>
				The foundation of the vast majority of Ethiopian meals is injera, a giant gray spongey pancake-like bread, upon whose strangely rubbery surface are served a vast array of foods, ranging from multicolored mounds of spicy stews to vegetable curries to cubes of raw meat.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mode of eating is highly communal, with everyone gathering around a large circular metal tray of injera heavily laden with food as hands go back and forth scooping up from the various piles of foodstuffs with strips of injera torn from the edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				All this can take some getting used to. Tourists have been known to mistake injera for the tablecloth or for kitchen flannel. Also, the bread's bitter, slightly sour taste can put some off. But injera's subtle taste-enhancing power lies in how it contrasts beautifully with, as well as tempers, the fiery sauces it accompanies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another bonus of eating Ethiopian is that injera is made from tef -- the world's smallest grain -- which Ethiopians have grown and obsessed about for millennia. In America and Europe it is increasingly viewed as a "super grain," up there with quinoa and spelt, being high in protein and calcium, and gluten-free.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of all of the above will have your taste buds doing somersaults, while also being good for you. Most Ethiopian dishes are nutrient-dense and low in fat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond the endless dishes on offer, it's essential to try Ethiopian coffee after a meal. Ethiopia is reportedly the birthplace of quality Arabica coffee, and its coffees are widely praised as some of the best in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are the 5 essential dishes to try:
			</p>
				<h2>
					Tibs
				</h2>
				<img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_602,c_fill,g_auto,h_339,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190205144959-shekla-tibs.jpg">
				<p>
					Sliced beef or lamb, pan-fried in butter, garlic and onion, tibs is one of the most popular dishes among Ethiopians.
				</p>
				<p>
					t comes in a variety of forms, varying in type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. A particularly recommended variation is shekla tibs, in which the strips of meat arrive at your table roasting atop a clay pot stoked with hot coals -- dramatic and delicious.
				</p>
				<p>
					Historically, tibs was served to pay a compliment or show respect to someone. Today it's still viewed as a special dish, hence its popularity for commemorating special events and holidays. At the same time, though, if you walk into a rowdy bar on a Friday afternoon in Ethiopia's rambunctious capital, Addis Ababa, it's likely that most of the revelers will be enthusiastically ordering and eating tibs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, the meat of the tibs that arrives at your table has just been cleaved from carcasses hanging outside beside the restaurant's entrance. Don't be put off; meat rarely comes fresher or tastier.
				</p>

				<h2>kitfo</h2>
				<p>
					Made from the leanest meat, kitfo is viewed as a big treat by ordinary Ethiopians, while its nutritional powers are also praised. (image is at the top)
				</p>
				<p>
					Kitfo can be served with aib (like dry cottage cheese) and gomen (minced spinach), a recommended pairing making the meal even more delicious, as well as especially filling -- highly recommended after a hard day's traveling or if one is confronted with a hangover after a long night.
				</p>
				<h2>Beyainat</h2>
				<img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_602,c_fill,g_auto,h_339,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190205151132-beyainatu.jpg">
				<p>
					The name of Ethiopia's most popular vegetarian dish translates as "a bit of every type," hence your injera arrives blanketed in piles of tasty and colorful vegetables, potatoes, curries, lentil stews and more, creating a riot of colors and tastes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to Ethiopia's strong tradition of religious fasting and abstaining from meat on Wednesdays and Fridays, beyainatu is widely available around the country, and served just about everywhere from fancy hotels to tiny food shacks beside the road. Hence when traveling or faced with a menu only printed in Amharic, beyainatu is a safe and simple go-to.
				</p>
				<h2>Tere Siga</h2>
				<img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_602,c_fill,g_auto,h_339,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190205153955-tere-siga.jpg">
				<p>
					Not for the faint-hearted, one of Ethiopia's most popular delicacies is cubes of raw red meat. Two people typically order half a kilo of tere siga to share, which is eaten with injera or bread to clasp the meat you carve off the raw slab, and dipped in copious amounts of mitmita.
				</p>
				<h2>Doro wot</h2>
				<img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_635,c_fill,g_auto,h_357,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190205171048-doro-wot.jpg">
				<p>
					Wot is Ethiopia's version of curry, and the ubiquitous companion of injera. While beef and goat are often used with wot, chicken -- doro in Amharic -- reigns as the wot champion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doro wot is made with chicken drumsticks or wings cooked and served in a hot sauce of butter, onion, chilli, cardamom and berbere. In the midst of this stew incongruously bobs a hard-boiled egg. It proves a delicious accompaniment -- typically offered to a guest as a sign of respect.
				</p>
				<p>
					For Ethiopians, doro wot is the go-to meal of celebration during national and religious festivals (the day before, women can be seen everywhere carrying upside-down clucking chickens by their feet).
